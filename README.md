# visa-site

> A consolidation of infomation on visas and extensions thereof for nations all around the world.

# Technical Summary

> Although this site does not have any content yet and is not complete. I wanted to use it  as a demonstration
of using a router and navigating through and displaying different components, as well as using HTTP requests.
This site has a lot of Javascript that could simulate some of the problems one might address making a larger-scale
website.

# General Summary

> The premise of this website is to consolidate information on long-term visa availability for different nations
around the world and take some of the frustration out of the bureaucratic side of living an ex-pat or remote lifestyle.
